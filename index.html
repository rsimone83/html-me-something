            <h2>THE FALL</h2>
            <p>In the fall of 2009 after having graduated from Johnson and Wales University<br>
                with my Bachelor's in Management and Administration, I was excited to begin<br>
                my the next chapter of my life. I enlisted in U.S. NAVY as an Air Traffic Controller<br> 
                in the Delayed Entry Program while awaiting my leave date of September 9th,<br>
                I meticuslously planned my future.

            <h3>How One Missed Step</h3>
            <p>On a rainy summer afternoon in June I experinced the one moment that would change my life as I knew it.<br>
                While helping my girlfriend and her sister move furmiture into their first apartment I sustained a <br>
                severe ankle ingjury after missing a step and falling off stairway. The injury would derail my plans <br> 
                of service, travel, and success; and set me on a journey of despire, depression, and redemption.
